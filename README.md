## About Me

I'm a Computer Science (AI & ML) student at Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology, graduating 2027. I specialize in building end-to-end AI systems — from LLM-powered pipelines and agentic workflows to NLP dashboards that turn raw data into business insight.

I don't do toy projects. Everything I build is framed around a real problem with a real output someone can actually use.

## Featured Projects

### 🧠 Review Intelligence — NLP Topic Modeling Pipeline
> Turn thousands of customer reviews into instant insights

End-to-end NLP system that ingests any CSV of customer reviews, automatically discovers topics using transformer embeddings + BERTopic, and generates plain-English summaries per topic. Built a full Streamlit dashboard with demo mode, upload mode, keyword search, and a "How It Works" page for technical audiences.

**Stack:** `sentence-transformers` · `BERTopic` · `UMAP` · `HDBSCAN` · `BART` · `Streamlit`
**Data:** 568,454 Amazon Fine Food Reviews · 121 topics discovered automatically
